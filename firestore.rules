/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all private user data,
 * such as profiles and quiz results. All data nested under a user's ID is considered private and
 * is accessible only by that authenticated user. Publicly shared content, like quizzes and leaderboards,
 * is readable by anyone but has strict controls on who can create or modify content.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into top-level collections for shared/public data
 * (quizzes, leaderboards) and a primary user-centric collection (/users/{userId}) that
 * houses all data specific to a single user, including their profile and quiz history. This
 * structural segregation ensures that private data cannot be accidentally listed or exposed publicly.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: Users are strictly confined to their own data tree under `/users/{userId}`. They cannot
 *   read, write, or even list the contents of another user's private collections.
 * - Public Read-Only Content: Core app content like quizzes and their questions are globally readable
 *   to allow any user (authenticated or not) to take them. Writes to this content are disabled at the
 *   rules level, assuming content is managed by a backend process or admin SDK.
 * - Authenticated-Only Creation/Updates: For public collections where users can contribute, like leaderboards,
 *   creation and updates are limited to signed-in users who must correctly identify themselves.
 * - Immutability: Critical relational fields (like a user's ID within their own documents) are enforced
 *   as immutable after creation to prevent data re-association or ownership hijacking.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: To ensure fast and secure authorization checks, this ruleset relies
 * on denormalized ownership fields within documents. For instance, a document in `/users/{userId}/quiz_results`
 * must contain a `userId` field that matches the `{userId}` from the path. This avoids costly `get()` calls
 * and makes the ownership relationship explicit and easy to verify.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: Private user data (profiles, results) is stored in a user-specific path
 * `/users/{userId}/...`, while public data (quizzes, leaderboards) is in separate top-level collections.
 * This separation is a core security principle that makes it impossible to write a query that
 * accidentally mixes private and public data, providing a strong security guarantee for list operations.
